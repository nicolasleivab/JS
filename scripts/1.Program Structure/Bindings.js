/* Expressions and Statements */

/*
Roughly speaking, an expression is any piece of code that produces a value while 
a statement stands on its own and performs an action that 'changes something'.
In JavaScript, wherever a statement is expected, you can also write an expression (called expression statement). 
The reverse is not true, you cannot write a statement where JavaScript expects an expression.
A program is built when you declare a set of statements, in JavaScript you can use a semicolon to chain statements
